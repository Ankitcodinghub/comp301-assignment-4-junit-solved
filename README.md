This assignment is a little different from the rest of the assignments in COMP 301. In most other assignments, you are given a description of a class or algorithm, and your job is to write code that implements the class. Most of your work inevitably goes into the src/main folder. In this assignment, you are still given a description of a class, but you are not required to write code that implements it. Instead, you are asked to write unit tests to verify if an arbitrary implementation of the class is correct. Since you’ll be writing unit tests, most of your work will go in the src/test folder.

Each of Novice, Adept, and Jedi below describes a different class or classes for which you should write unit tests. When you submit your work to Gradescope, the autograder will run your unit tests on a series of different (hidden) implementations of the classes. Your tests must correctly identify which implementations are correct and which ones contain a bug.

Again, you are not required to implement the classes described below for this assignment. The goal of this assignment is to give you practice writing unit tests with JUnit 4.

Novice

The first class you should write tests for is called Alphabetizer. Write unit tests for Alphabetizer in the src/test/java/com/comp301/a04junit/NoviceAlphabetizerTests file.

An empty, unimplemented version of the class can be found in src/main/java/com/comp301/a04junit/alphabetizer/Alphabetizer.java. You should test this class file when writing unit tests. This class file is the one you should test when writing unit tests. The unit tests you write should verify that Alphabetizer matches the algorithm specification given below.

The Alphabetizer class is intended to sort an array of String values alphabetically and process the sorted strings one at a time.

Constructor

The Alphabetizer class has a constructor with the following signature:

public Alphabetizer(String[] arr)

When creating a new Alphabetizer instance, the constructor takes in an unsorted array of String values as an argument. The Alphabetizer instance keeps a reference to the provided array internally, and must never modify or manipulate the array.

next() method

Once an instance of Alphabetizer has been created, it can be used to process the elements in the array, one at a time, in alphabetized order. This can be accomplished by repeatedly calling the next() method. Each time next() is called, a different string from the array is returned. Strings are returned in alphabetized order.

After every string from the array has been returned once, next() should throw a NoSuchElementException if it is called again.

hasNext() method

Instead of relying on catching a NoSuchElementException to check if there are still remaining strings left to process, another option is to use the hasNext() method. hasNext() returns a boolean value which is true if there are still strings left, and false if there are no more strings left. In other words, hasNext() will only return false if the object is in a state where a call to next() would throw a NoSuchElementException.

Example usage

Here is an example usage of the Alphabetizer class. Imagine a new Alphabetizer object is created for the array { “b1”, “a1”, “c1” }. Calling next() on the object for the first time will return “a1”. The second time next() is called, it will return “b1”; and the third time it is called, it will return “c1”. After the third time, any future calls to next() will throw a NoSuchElementException.

Adept

In adept, you should write unit tests for the ItemImpl and PositionImpl classes that you designed for assignment a02-adventure. Write unit tests for ItemImpl in the src/test/java/com/comp301/a04junit/AdeptItemTests file, and tests for PositionImpl in src/test/java/com/comp301/a04junit/AdeptPositionTests.

Empty, unimplemented versions of these two classes can be found in src/main/java/com/comp301/a04junit/adventure. These class files are the ones you should be testing when writing unit tests.

The unit tests you write should verify that ItemImpl and PositionImpl match the algorithm specification given in a02-adventure. Refer to that assignment write-up for details about the exact algorithm specification.

Jedi

In adept, you should write unit tests for the InventoryImpl and PlayerImpl classes that you designed for assignment a02-adventure. Write unit tests for InventoryImpl in the src/test/java/com/comp301/a04junit/JediInventoryTests file, and tests for PlayerImpl in src/test/java/com/comp301/a04junit/JediPlayerTests.

Empty, unimplemented versions of these two classes can be found in src/main/java/com/comp301/a04junit/adventure. These class files are the ones you should be testing when writing unit tests.

The unit tests you write should verify that InventoryImpl and PlayerImpl match the algorithm specification given in a02-adventure. Refer to that assignment write-up for details about the exact algorithm specification.

Points

Novice – The unit tests you write for the Alphabetizer class are worth a total of 4 points.

Adept – The unit tests you write for the ItemImpl and PositionImpl classes are worth 4 points each, for a total of 8 points.

Jedi – The unit tests you write for the InventoryImpl and PlayerImpl classes are worth 4 points each, for a total of 8 points. Style – Conforming to the Google style guide is worth 1 point.

Important note about grading: When calculating your grade percent for this assignment, a point value of 11 or less will be considered a 0% on the assignment, while a grade of 21 will be considered a 100%. Any grade between 11 and 21 will be linearly scaled between 0% and 100%. You can calculate your grade percent with the following formula: Math.max(p – 11, 0) / 10, where p is the number of points that the autograder gave you.

Why such a weird grading policy? Because submitting the starter code gives you an 11/21 on the assignment. This is because the empty starter code unit tests pass no matter what, which means they correctly identify the properly implemented classes (but not the bugged classes). You could equivalently change the starter code so that it fails no matter what, and then it would correctly identify the bugged classes (but not the correct classes). The crucial part of writing unit tests is not to universally pass or fail, but instead to pass and fail at the right time.
